# e-Commerce - Back-End

## Description

This project was constructed in order to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. This project is about configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. Through this project, I learnt about:

-ORMs (Object Relational Mapping)
- Sequelize and SQL
- Async and Await functions
- API Routes
- Data validation
- Data relations/associations

The image below shows the application in Insomnia.
